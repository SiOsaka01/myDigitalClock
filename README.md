# myDigitalClock
This was a javascriptclass task. As my eyesight is poor and I would benefit from having a digital clock on my phone which is easier to see at any time, I will make a project from it. 
I have 3 additional goals:
1. Night time mode; 2. has a timer or stopwatch feature; 3. Has numerous comments and pseudocode included, along with a separate css and js file.
